            <h2>CITY PALACE</h2>
            <p>Located in the heart of old Jaipur, the City Palace is a spectacular example of the amalgamation of Rajput and Mughal architecture. Commissioned to be built by the founder of Jaipur, Maharaja Jai Singh II, this lavish palace includes the living quarters of the erstwhile royal family, some of whom still reside in a private wing. It also houses the Diwan-e-Am (hall for public audience with the king), Diwan-e-Khas (hall for private meetings of the king with his noblemen), Mubarak Mahal and the Maharani’s Palace (queen’s palace). Mubarak Mahal houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, which displays the royal family’s personal belongings like garments featuring exquisite embroideries. The Maharani’s Palace showcases one of the largest collections of weapons in the country. And at Diwan-e-Khas stands two gigantic silver vessels, each 1.6 m tall, which are said to be the largest silver objects in the world. They were supposedly used to transport holy water from River Ganges for the royal family. The palace also boasts several rare artworks.</p>
