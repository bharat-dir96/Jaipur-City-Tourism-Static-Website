            <h2>JAL MAHAL</h2>
            <p>Jal Mahal is one of the most iconic monuments in Jaipur and the capital of Rajasthan in India. Jal Mahal is a spectacular example of Rajput architecture, with its five storeys tall symmetrical structure built entirely of sandstone. The palace is situated in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur, India and was commissioned by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in the early 18th century.

                Jal Mahal has a unique design, with each storey getting progressively smaller in size. The palace has a total of four floors, with the top floor being used as a viewing platform for the Maharaja and his guests. The first three floors of the palace are submerged in the lake, which helps to keep the building cool in the hot Jaipur summers.</p>
