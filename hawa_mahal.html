            <h2>HAWA MAHAl</h2>
            <p>Hawa Mahal, one of the best places to visit in Jaipur, features a splendid fusion of Islamic, Mughal, and Rajput architectural styles. Its domed canopies, floral patterns, lotus motifs, and fluted pillars, all reflect the rich Rajput style. Complementing these elements is the filigree work in stone and lavish arches, both of which draw influence from the Islamic style of architecture.

                Designed in red and pink sandstone, this one-of-its-kind palace boasts of a pyramidal shape. It has five stories and rises up to a height of 50 feet. The 953 windows featured on the front part of the palace lend it a honeycombed hive look. Thanks to the exceptional latticework on these windows, the palace experiences a cooling effect as the breeze blows in through them. Delicately designed hanging cornices are another attractive aspect of Hawa Mahalâ€™s architecture.</p>
